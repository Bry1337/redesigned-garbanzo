# Kotlin-MVVM News Application


## Framework Included
 1. RxJava2 - Reactive Programming
 2. Dagger2 - Dependency Injection
 3. Retrofit2 - HttpClient
 4. OkHttp3 - HttpClient
 5. Glide - Image Processor
 6. Databinding - Binding UI components from layout to datasources
 7. Navigation Component - Managing complex navigation, deep linking and arguments passing

## Note

 - Everything is set, just clone it and build it.
 - Added Unit Testing, used [Kluent](https://github.com/MarkusAmshove/Kluent) 3rd party library for Fluent-Assertions
 - I used 3rd party libraries to create a clean and maintainable architecture manifesting LiveData usage
 - This application is built using MVVM to make the architecture cleaner, more readable and maintanable
 - Used Navigation Component for Navigating via Fragments  because it simplifies the lifecycle greatly as you donâ€™t have to deal with complexity of interaction between Activity and Fragment lifecycles.
